The following elements of a forecasting challenge workflow are included in this repo. GitHub Actions are used to automate tasks.

1)  Generation of targets
2)  Processing of submissions
3)  Generation of baseline forecasts
4)  Evaluation (scoring) of submitted forecasts
5)  Generation of Quarto dashboard
6)  Generation of STAC catalog
7)  Download of weather drivers for forecasts
8)  Creation of Docker containers with supporting software
