## Overiew: Forecast the targets!

The "targets" are time-series of National Ecological Observatory Network ([NEON](https://www.neonscience.org)) data for use in model development and forecast evaluation.

The targets are updated as new NEON data is made available.

The 10 targets, which are represented by five "themes," were specifically chosen to include ecosystem, community, and population dynamics.
The themes and links to the target files are included below.

## Where to start {#sec-starting-sites}

If you are just getting started, we recommend the following focal sites for each of the five "themes." The first site in the list is the recommended starting site.

-   Terrestrial: `r terrestrial_focal_sites`
-   Aquatics: `r aquatics_focal_sites`
-   Phenology: `r phenology_focal_sites`
-   Beetles: `r beetles_focal_sites`
-   Ticks: `r ticks_focal_sites`

As you develop your forecasting skills and want to expand to more sites, the targets are available at all 81 NEON sites.
You may also consider submitting forecasts to sites that match your interests.
For example, a winter class may be more interested in forecasting southern sites than a summer class, which may focus on more northern sites.

More information about NEON sites can be found in the [site metadata](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-ci/main/catalog/sites/collection.json) and on NEON's [website](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/explore-field-sites)

## Explore the targets and themes {#sec-targets}

Information on the target files for the five "themes" is below.
In the tables,

-   "duration" is the time-step of the variable where `P1D` is a daily mean, and `P1W` is a weekly total.

-   The "forecast horizon" is the number of days-ahead that we want you to forecast.

-   The "latency" is the time between data collection and data availability in the target file

### Terrestrial fluxes

![](https://www.neonscience.org/sites/default/files/styles/640x384/public/2020-10/48540914326_749b0c2627_o.jpg?h=d1cb525d&itok=0SkNONOu)

The exchange of water and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the land is akin to the breathing rate and lung capacity of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. 

The terrestrial flux theme challenges you to forecast the gas exchange at up to 47 sites across the U.S.

There are two variables that you can forecast.

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
read_csv(c(url_P1D, url_PT30M), show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  distinct(variable, duration) |> 
  left_join(target_metadata, by = c("variable","duration")) |> 
  filter(variable %in% c("nee","le")) |> 
  select(-class) |> 
  rename(`forecast horizon` = horizon) |> 
  knitr::kable()

```

#### Daily mean

The daily mean target file is located at the following URL.

```{r}
url_P1D <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=neon4cast/duration=P1D/terrestrial_daily-targets.csv.gz"
```

You can directly load it into R using the following.

```{r}
terrestrial_targets <- read_csv(url_P1D, show_col_types = FALSE)
```

The file contains the following columns.

```{r echo = FALSE}
terrestrial_targets |>

```

and the time series for the focal sites

```{r}
terrestrial_targets |> 
  filter(site_id %in% terrestrial_focal_sites) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime, y = observation)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(variable~site_id, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw()
```

#### Supporting data

The 30-minute duration targets are designed support models that require sub-daily data.
Forecasts from sub-daily models should be aggregated to a daily mean before submitting to the Challenge.
The 30-minute data URL is found at:

```{r}
url_PT30M <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=neon4cast/duration=PT30M/terrestrial_30min-targets.csv.gz"
```

Freshwater surface water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a all influence drinking water quality, are critical for life in aquatic environments, and can represent the health of the ecosystem.

The aquatics theme challenges you to forecast daily mean water quality variables at up-to 7 lakes and 27 river/stream NEON sites.

```{r echo = FALSE}
url <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=neon4cast/duration=P1D/aquatics-targets.csv.gz"

### Phenology

![](https://phenocam.nau.edu/data/latest/NEON.D01.BART.DP1.00033.jpg)

Phenology (the changes in plant canopies over the year) has been identified as one of the primary ecological fingerprints of global climate change.

Greenness and redness, as measured by a camera looking down at the top of vegetation, are quantitative measures of phenology.
The phenology theme challenges you to forecast daily mean greenness and/or redness at up to 47 terrestrial NEON sites.

```{r}
url <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=neon4cast/duration=P1D/phenology-targets.csv.gz"
read_csv(url, show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  distinct(variable, duration) |> 
  left_join(target_metadata, by = c("variable","duration")) |> 
  filter(variable %in% c("gcc_90","rcc_90")) |> 
  select(-class) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

The daily mean target file is located at the following URL.

```{r}

### Beetle communities

![](https://www.neonscience.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_1170px/public/image-content-images/Beetles_pinned.jpg)

Sentinel species (such as beetles) can warn humans of environmental risks, so they are particularly useful for such monitoring and forecasting efforts because they can provide surrogates for other co-located components of biodiversity.

The beetle theme challenges you to forecast weekly ground beetle (Family: Carabidae) abundance and richness (two measures of biodiversity) at up to 47 terrestrial NEON sites.

```{r echo = FALSE}
url <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=neon4cast/duration=P1W/beetles-targets.csv.gz"
read_csv(url, show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  distinct(variable, duration) |> 
  left_join(target_metadata, by = c("variable","duration")) |> 
  filter(variable %in% c("abundance","richness")) |> 
  select(-class) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

The daily mean target file is located at the following URL.

```{r}
url <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=neon4cast/duration=P1W/beetles-targets.csv.gz"
```

You can directly load it into R using the following.

```{r}
beetles_targets <- read_csv(url, show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}
beetles_targets |> 
  filter(site_id %in% beetles_focal_sites) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime, y = observation)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(variable~site_id, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Tick populations

![](https://www.neonscience.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_2600x2600/public/image-content-images/tick-image.jpg)

The target species for the tick population forecasts are **Amblyomma americanum** nymphal ticks.
A.
americanum is a vector of ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and southern tick-associated rash illness.
The species is present in the eastern United States, and their populations are expanding.
There is a correlation between tick population abundance and disease incidence, meaning forecasts for tick abundance have the potential to aid in our understanding of disease risk through time and space.

The tick theme challenges you to forecast weekly Amblyomma americanum nymphal tick abundance at up-to 9 terrestrial NEON sites.

```{r echo = FALSE}
url <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=neon4cast/duration=P1W/ticks-targets.csv.gz"
read_csv(url, show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  distinct(variable, duration) |> 
  left_join(target_metadata, by = c("variable","duration")) |> 
  filter(variable %in% c("amblyomma_americanum")) |>  select(-class) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

The weekly target file is located at the following URL.

```{r}
"https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=neon4cast/duration=P1W/ticks-targets.csv.gz"
```

You can directly load it into R using the following.

```{r}
ticks_targets <- read_csv(url, show_col_types = FALSE)
```

The file contains the following columns.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ticks_targets |> 
  na.omit() |> 
  head() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

and the time series for the focal sites

```{r}
ticks_targets |> 
  filter(site_id %in% ticks_focal_sites) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime, y = observation)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(variable~site_id, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw()
```
